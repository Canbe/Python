###所谓“Python 之禅 ”的几条原则

_The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters_

**Beautiful is better than ugly.**

**Simple is better than complex.**

**Complex is better than complicated.**

**Readability counts.**

**There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.**

**Now is better than never.**
